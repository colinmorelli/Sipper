# Sipper

Sipper is an Objective-C++ wrapper around PJSIP for use in iOS applications. It's goal is to simplify the code required for applications that want to interface with PJSIP.

# Installation

The easiest way to get Sipper into your project is through CocoaPods

```
pod 'Sipper', '0.0.1'
```

This will pull in Sipper and link your application with static libraries for OpenSSL, OpenH.264, and PJSIP. In addition, it requires dependencies on CoreAudio, AudioToolbox, and CFNetwork which will be managed for you by Cocoapods.
